Video done by me, using OBS Studio software for screen recording and VideoPad Video Editor (by NCH Software) for video editing.

game does not work for mobile, only laptop, PC, or basically anywhere that has a keyboard of up down left right arrows since the game only detects these key presses in order to move the character, and not touchscreen controls (idk how do this yet bruh)

## 2. Building Process of this 2D Unity Game <a name = "buildingprocess"></a>

Heavily inspired from Mario, the pixel style art, and the movements of the game, and objectives
This game is built on Unity, so obviusly will need to download [Unity](https://unity.com/download), and an IDE to do the C# script coding, which I used VS code

Bird sprite taken from the unity tutorial for complete beginners, and the cloud spawner code and idea too
