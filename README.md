# 19.-2D-Unity-Game :bird:üè∞
While trying to develop a 2D Unity game for a friend of mine (Github: [WolfPark](https://github.com/wolfparktaerim)), I thought that while my friend decides on the art aesthetics of the game, I could further familiarise myself with the process of creating a Unity game by creating a prototype 2D Unity game in advance, with sprites I found from Googling as a placeholder for the art aesthetics. This 2D Unity game can serve as the foundation for any further developments in the video game [WolfPark](https://github.com/wolfparktaerim) is trying to develop.

Here is the link of the deployed 2D Unity game on '[itch.io](https://itch.io/)': https://windjammer6.itch.io/2d-unity-game-by-windjammer6 (Click the link to play the game!)

Here is a demonstration of 'winning' the 2D Unity game:

Here is a demonstration of 'losing' the 2D Unity game:

Disclaimer: This 2D Unity game does not work for mobile, only for laptop, PC, or basically any electronic devices that has a keyboard since the game only detects key presses from a keyboard in order to move the character. It does not detect touchscreen controls. (idk how to do that yet, but I believe shouldn't be too difficult) You can open the 2D Unity game on mobile, but you will have no way to move the character.

For this prototype 2D Unity game, there is a very vague storyline, as I did not dwell too much on that, but it is more focused towards adding various interesting features via C# programming into the game. Here is a list of features in the 2D Unity game:  
*Character-related:*  
1. Horizontal movement (left and right)
2. Firing projectiles ('bow' and 'arrow')
3. Health system (can take damage from enemy NPCs)

*Friendly NPC-related:*  
1. Interact with NPCs
2. Chief NPC can give the 'bow' weapon to the character

*Enemy NPC-related:*  
1. Chase character when the character enters their trigger range
2. Deal damage to the character when they come into contact with the character
3. Health system (3 lives for small enemies, 5 lives for big enemies) (can take damage from projectiles fired by the character)

*Background-related:*
1. Constructed different sections of the 2D Unity game map, 'Village', 'Open Plains', 'Forest', and the final area with the legendary sword
2. Cloud movement
3. AI music on loop, generated by [AIVA](https://www.aiva.ai/)

*Game Objectives-related (in time order of the game):*  
1. Find a way to leave the castle-village (which is that you need to interact with the Chief NPC to get the 'bow' weapon, before the Guard NPC allows you to leave by opening the castle gates)
2. Survive the forest with enemies using the weapon (if the character loses all its health then you will lose the game)
3. Obtain the legendary sword at the end of the level to clear the game successfully

## 2. Building Process of this 2D Unity Game <a name = "buildingprocess"></a>

Heavily inspired from Mario and genshin (interaction stuffs), the pixel style art, and the movements of the game, and objectives
This game is built on Unity, so obviusly will need to download [Unity](https://unity.com/download), and an IDE to do the C# script coding, which I used VS code

Bird sprite taken from the unity tutorial for complete beginners, and the cloud spawner code and idea too

Other sprites is taken from googling and taking whatever music that pops up

Variations in sprite colours, and sprite (like the bird holding a bow) is done using Photoshop

the music is i use [AIVA](https://www.aiva.ai/), an AI that generates original music, to generate

improvements: boss fight
restart/respawn feature if chafacter dies
area name with trigger and music changes
character is still a bit buggy as it might rotate
friemdly NPCs should not be able to hit by projectiles
enemy NPC should not rotate or leave the ground or chase endlessly? and stop chasing and returning upon character going too far
bug of jumping out of map
safehouse map? To regain HP as safe zone
main menu
replay game or exit upon finishing the game feature
